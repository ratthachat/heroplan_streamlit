Lets assume you are an expert in a mobile game "Empires & Puzzles" from Zynga. Now I would like you to compare the two cards for pros and cons of each card. 

Before detailed examples, let clearly understood general aspects of the game 
	- The game has PvE and PvP mode where
		○ PvP mode is the main focus, and mana speed & control is very important . Timing is almost everything, and slow-speed is generally undesirable except slow-speed with super-high impact

	One exception is in the special "rush" tournament, where all speeds are upgraded to "Very Fast" (still all magic, ninja & styx will not get any advantages there, since they still need to charge multiple times)

		○ PvE mode is lower priority, but is still of concerned. Here, we can wait (or use items) to charge all slow speed heroes to show their potential
	- More about speed (already taken into account on troops speed up -- see below):
		○ Very Fast = 6 tiles (usually can fire at least twice in the PvP)
		○ Fast = 7-8 tiles (usually can fire around 1-2  in PvP)
		○ Average = 9 tiles (perhaps fire once in PvP)
		○ Slow = 10 tiles (it may die before it can fire, so you need healer to keep this hero alive while waiting for enough tiles)
		○ Very Slow = 12 tiles (usually no one use this speed beside PvE or rush mode)
	
	Magic, Ninja & Styx are special as they have different charges.
		○ Magic: 1st charge is Very Fast (6 tiles), and 2nd charge is slow (12 tiles)
		○ Styx: 1st charge is Very Fast (6 tiles), 2nd charge is Fast (8-9 tiles), and 3rd charge is "Slow" (12 tiles), 
		○ Ninja: 1st charge is Extreme Fast (5 tiles), 2nd charge is average speed (10 tiles), while 3rd is "impractical", extremely slow (13 tiles) and do not need to be considered
	With this multi-charge mechanic, Ninja, Styx and Magic are inherently mitigate the enemies mana-cut (good thing)
	
	You can see that "Very Fast" heroes usually cast at least twice, but to make this hero useful, the very fast special should provide some considerable effect to either enemies or allies. For "Slow", the effect must be pretty strong to be able to turn the table all around (e.g. Grimsteel or Starlass are good examples)

	Some heroes which can increase mana directly are valuable. Uncleansible mana-generation buff is also good.
	
	- Dance, growth and stack are special buffs which cannot be dispel by regular means (still can be dispel by few very special skills)

	- The game has Limit breaking (LB1 or LB2), talents emblems (+20 or +25) which will increase hero stat more that what is stated. Also increase DoT (see below)

	- The game has special troops to be equipped with heroes
		○ Magic, Styx, Mana troop can speed up the special skills (already taken into account in mana note above)
		○ Legendary troop can speed up mana, increase attack, defense and HP significantly. DoT will also increase in the same scale of attack boost.

	- DoT (Damage over Time) ailment. DoT is usually a good damage dealer to increase a lot to regular instant damage. There are many types of DoT e.g. Poison, Bleed, Water, Sand and Burn. Different types of DoT will stack together so its damage can be very substantial (one good synergy strategy), while same type of DoT will overwrite each other.

	As mentioned above, if heroes have LB1 or LB2, +20 or +25, his DoT will increase more than what is stated in statistics. Maximally speaking, equipped with legendary troop, DoT can be almost twice as stated in the stat.

	For example, Viselus' poison is stated as 574 per 4 turns. If we equipped him with LB2, +25 and legendary troop, his poison will increase to around 1100.

	**Important** whenever you find a DoT hero, always speculate the upgraded DoT damage a little bit below 200% (you can see examples below)

	DoT has weakness on Toon heroes nevertheless, as Toon heroes has 75% chance to resist all ailments. 
	
	- Toon heroes can resist all ailments including dance, but Toon cannot resist "wither" and "insanity".

	- Each class has a talent, but the most important classes to aware are
		○ Cleric : it has 30% chance to reject all mana-related attack & ailments
		○ Monk: it has 50% chance to reject all ailments (but not mana-cut)
		○ Druid: it has 20% chance to summon minions to protect the hero (equivalent to 15% self-heal each), so translate to at least 10% more HP for this hero during the fight
	- When the text say "minor damage", it actually mean 50% damage of the stated main damage

On analysis, do this:
	- Be conscious and very serious on quantitative number, not only on qualitative. For examples, 
		○ 5% dodge chance is almost nothing. Almost elemental-links (except 2017 family) are nothing.
		○ 200%-damage of Hero with 1000 attack stat, is much better than 300%-damage of Hero with only 500 attack stat - so be conscious on quantitative number
		○ Stat is very important, for examples, 3-stars defensive stat of around 500 is much quicker to be killed than 5-stars defensive stat of 1000. And 5-stars attack stat of 1000 hit much harder than 3-stars attack of 500 since the damage calculation is non-linear.

	- Do not need to emphasize the weaker hero. Be decisive to say which hero is better in the end in most situation.
	- Be very precise on damage (and other number calculation) as shown in various examples below. When comparing damage output, always use special-%-damage x attack-stat to compare.

Following examples below in analysis style and format

If the Special Skill is fully charged, all enemies get two stacks. An enemy can have up to 10 stacks.']



Bennu Description:
Element: Blue

Defense: 859
Health: 1563
Speed: Average

********************
Head to Head Analysis
********************

Overall: These two heroes have partial similarity. Namely, both can do counterattack and damage reduction. However, the main difference is that Willow has wider variety of skills. 

Stat: Their stats looks comparable, so we may focus mainly on special skills.


Bennu Advantage
-----------------------
Bennu is specialized on counter-attack. He generally has a bit stronger counterattack compared to Willow on 5 turns. Also, his damage-reduction is 5% more than Willow, but more importantly, the damage reduction is applied "after" counterattack. This make the counterattack very strong while the damage receive very minor. 

For example, original 100 damage to one ally may produce 120 counter on turn 3, and the ally will receive only 50 damage himself.

In contrast, Willow reduce the damage "before" counter attack. Therefore, in the above example, Willow's ally will receive 55 damage, and counter only 55*1.15 = 63.25 damage. You can see that Bennu produce almost twice the damage of Willow.

Bennu passive allow him 60% chance to clean latest cleansable ailment which is good. Also 60% chance to heal 10% is kind of nice, but inferior overall to Willow's 2nd passive.

Willow Advantage
-----------------------
Having said that, Willow is a kind of swiss-knife who does a different of thing. In addition to counterattack on his 2nd charge, Willow also does 3 other things :

	1) Willow let all allies bypass all enemies defensive buff, so enemies defense-buff are now useless
	2) With passive 1, Willow will give -10% mana-(de)generation stack to enemies. This is uncleansible and last forever, which is fairly strong
	3) With passive 2, Willow will give 15% heal with 100% chance on 2nd charge.

Although this 2nd charge is slower than Bennu's average speed, it is more applicable when facing defense oriented team, because of the bypassing. Also, with 15% heal and mana-degeneration-stack, Willow allow the team to survive better.

To summarize, while Bennu is specialized only on hard-hitter opponent, Willow can face both hard-hitter and also defense-oriented opponent. In the latter situation, Willow 1st-charge becomes useful as it is very fast and can dispel and block all defensive buff on enemies.

Head-to-Head Synergy Analysis with Other Heroes:
------------------
With swiss-knife property, Willow seems to be more suitable to synergy to various kind of other heroes compared to Bennu. For example, both synergize well with other-type defense buffers, but Willow alone synergize also well with hard-hitter (because Willow give the bypassing to the hard-hitter)

Winner:
---------
Willow is a winner here with small margin due to his/her wider applications though a bit weaker counterattacker. Willow also has a slightly more stat power than Bennu, especially on Defense + Health stats which are most important for support heroes. When using Willow (as well as many other Magic heroes), you need to enter the "battle of endurance" (or long-game mode) though.

=============================
Example 2:
Starlass vs.  Xandrella

Starlass Description:
Element: Green
Star: 5
Power: 1062
Attack: 1032
Defense: 1165
Health: 1788
Speed: Slow
Class: Ranger

Special Skills
['This Special Skill never misses its targets.', 'Deals 550% damage to target and nearby enemies', 'Automatically does 701 damage to the hit enemy and consumes 75% mana from hit enemy every time when the hit enemy’s mana gets full for 3 tuns.']
Passives
['Resist Poison: This character has innate resistance against Poison.', 'Share Received Damage: 20% of damage received by this charater is shared with other allies.']


Xandrella Description:
Element: Green
Star: 5
Power: 900
Attack: 844
Defense: 854
Health: 1724
Speed: Average
Class: Sorcerer

Special Skills
['Deals 450% damage to target and all Ice enemies.', 'Automatically does 438 damage to the target and all Ice enemies, when their mana is full and reduces their mana by 50% for 4 turns.', 'Alters the power of all Nature shields on the board. When an attacking Hero casts the special, the shields become enhanced and give +37% more mana. When a defending Hero casts the special, the shields become weakened and give -30% less mana.']

Passives
['Troop Mastery: This Passive Skill has two different functions based on if this character is in attack or in defense.', 'Passive Skill as attacking character: This character’s Troops deal +100% more additional damage against weaker element.', 'Passive Skill as defending character: This character receives -10% less additional damage from Troops of stronger element.']



********************
Head to Head Analysis
********************
Overall: These two heroes are actually quite similar in their main function. Namely, both are rangers which can do "mana control" which is one of the most important in the game. Both control mana with the same mechanic, by reducing mana of enemies when the mana-bar is full.

Starlass has 3 targets with slow, while Xandrella is average speed, but the number of targets depending on the number of ice enemies. 

Stat: Starlass Stat is 15%-20% better than Xandrella on both attack and defense. Starlass looks more premium quantitatively.


Xandrella Advantage
-----------------------
	- If there > 2 ice enemies, Xandrella can also hit 3 targets with quicker average speed
	- The quicker speed means Xandrella can better stop the enemy at the most critical moment
	- On Attack, Xandrella help other green heroes to charge faster by increase mana on the board's tiles (aka. Board shields), while on attack Xandrella negatively affect the green enemies by decrease the mana on the board tiles.
	- The passive make Xandrella tile attack quite good
	- Mana control of Starlass last only 3 turns while Xandrella last 4 turns.

Starlass Advantage
-----------------------
	- Clearly Starlass is much stronger stat-wise, so if %damage in special skill is equal, Starlass always hit harder and has better survivability. In fact, he has 20% better attack stat, and around 30% more defense stat.
	- Not only that, his special is considerably much stronger than Xandrella with 550% to 3 enemies. The 2nd effect is also much stronger i.e. 701 vs. 438 (Note that with LB2, +25 emblems, and legendary troops, both numbers are upgraded almost twice to around 1300 vs. 750)
	- The third effect is arguably no winner. Though Starlass reduce higher 75%, the reduction of 50% of Xandrella can make the 2nd effect activate again easier.
	- Though slower than Xandrella, if Starlass can fire, with the right partner, he has a chance to finish all 3 enemies with single blow, while it is much less likely with Xandrella.
	- His "never-miss" skill can be paired nicely with Gamble-attack-buff heroes like WuKong so that his special damage will be much stronger and still always hit. (though there are no green-gamble heroes, and WuKong is yellow, so off-color to Starlass). But there can be green-gamble heroes in the future.
	- His passive of 20% share damage make him even much better surviability, but his poison resistance is just a nice-to-have (nothing extraordinary)

Head-to-Head Synergy Analysis with Other Heroes:
------------------
As they both have the same main functional, they can be synergized by the same heroes. E.g. green defense-down (DD) or elemental defense down (EDD), or any other attack-buff heroes.

Winner:
---------
Starlass is a clear winner here. Though Starlass speed is at disadvantage, but once Starlass fires, Starlass will likely finish the job. This is generally true on both PvP and PvE.

=============================
Example 3:
Rochefort vs. Voidstar 

Rochefort Description: 
Element: Purple
Star: 5
Power: 928 
Attack: 883 
Defense: 850 
Health: 1835 
Speed: Average 
Class: Fighter 

Special Skills: 
['Deals 565% damage to the target and minor damage to nearby enemies.', 'If the targets is defeated in 3 turns all enemies receive 626 damage.'] 

Passives: ['When this character receives damage from Special Skills or in place of a character in Cover, there’s a 60% chance of deal 20% of the received damage on all enemies.'] 

Voidstar Description:
Element: Purple
Star: 5
Power: 1041 
Attack: 1003 
Defense: 1114 
Health: 1814 
Speed: Average 
Class: Paladin 

Special Skills: 
['This Special Skill never misses its targets.', 'Deals 620% damage to the target.', 'Heals all allies for 40% of the damage dealt.', 'All allies get +74% defense against Special Skills for 4 turns.'] 

Passives: ['Resist Poison: This character has innate resistance against Poison.', 'Share Received Damage: 20% of damage received by this charater is shared with other allies.']


********************
Head to Head Analysis
********************
Overall: These two are similar, average speed, purple, hard hitter. We can see that Voidstar is the more recent hero so better stat on all measures (around 15%).

Stat: Voidstar Stat is 15%-20% better than Rochefort on both attack and defense. Voidstar looks more premium quantitatively.

Rochefort Advantage
-----------------------
	- Only one advantage against Voidstar is Rochefort's secondary effect provided that the hit enemy is dead within 3 turns, which results in 626 damages to all enemies. 
	
	With LB2, +25 emblems, and legendary troops, 626 damages is upgraded almost twice to around 1150
	
Note that in 2022-2023, 1150 damages can consider to be good and send enemies to blink of the death, but in 2024 in which each hero has legendary troop and recent heroes will have HP as high as 3,000. So the 1000 to 1150 damage is good but not enough . So he needs another (perhaps purple) partner to fire with him
	
	
Voidstar Advantage
-----------------------
	- At the above stat, Voidstar special with his attack stat can deal 620%*1003 = 6218.6 while Rochefort's damage is 565% * 883 = 4,988.95. So Voidstar is around 20% hit harder than Rochefort
	- With "never-miss", Voidstar has potential to combine with the Gamble-attack-buff, and hit even harder
	- Void also provide excellent defense or survivability support with healing and strong defense buff
	- Voidstar defense / Rochefort defense = 1114 / 850 = 1.3106 , or around 31% better (they have the same HP)
	- Not only that, with passive to share 20% damage to friends, and with Paladin class, Voidstar is much more durable than Rochefort.

Head-to-Head Synergy Analysis with Other Heroes:
------------------
If function as a hard-hitter, both can have similar synergy to other hard hitters, preferably purple to be on-color. In that regard, Rochefort's 2nd effect can activate, and can produce total damage higher than Voidstar. 

Nevertheless, Voidstar's "special skill" defense buff can stack with "normal" defense buff, so he synergize also well with other defense-oriented heroes to protect the whole team.

Winner:
---------
Both are good, but Voidstar is the clear hero here. Note that on PvE mode, Rochefort can save your time because it can kill many enemies mob faster.


=============================
Example 4:
Aviana vs. Christine Daae 

Aviana Description:
Element: Yellow
Star: 5
Power: 957
Attack: 1001
Defense: 931
Health: 1582
Speed: Average
Class: Fighter

Special Skills:
['Deals 300% damage to the target and nearby enemies.', 'The target and nearby enemies are immune to new status effects buffs for 4 turns.', 'The caster and nearby allies get +50% critical chance for 4 turns.', 'Element Link gives all Holy allies +5% dodge chance for 6 turns. This effect cannot be dispelled.']

Passives:
['Resist Bleed Damage: This character has innate resistance against Bleed.', 'Mana on Buff Received: This character gains 5% mana when they receive a buff or a positive stack.']


Christine Daae Description:
Element: Yellow
Star: 5
Power: 957
Attack: 994
Defense: 894
Health: 1672
Speed: Fast
Class: Cleric

Special Skills:
['Deals 355% damage to the target and nearby enemies.', 'The target and nearby enemies dance to Ballad of Passion for 3 turns. All existing status effects will be removed when this effect is added.', 'Ballad of Passion', '* -40% acuracy.', '* -40% defense.', '* Gives immunity to new status effects. New dance status effects will replace this effect.', '* This effect cannot be dispelled. The effect is removed when the caster dies.']

Passives:
['Resist Attack Ailments: This character has innate resistance against status ailments that affect attack.', 'Heal when status ailment expires or is cleared: This character receives 5% health each time a status ailment expires or is cleansed, removed or reallocated from them. This effect can activate only once per turn.']


********************
Head to Head Analysis
********************
Overall: Both are yellow-hit3. However, Christine is faster and hit-harder. Christine dance is also effective prevent enemies buffs as Aviana, but much more superior as dance is uncleansible (except if the opponent team also has another dancer where new dance will replace the old dance).

Stat: These two have similar stats. 

Aviana Advantage
-----------------------
	- Only main advantage is 50% critical buff for nearby allies. This buff make tile attack 50% stronger than usual.
	- The 5% dodge chance from elemental-link is almost luxury. 5% is too small to be reliable.
	- Aviana's passive can make him effectively fast provided that his teammate give lots of buffs.

Christine Advantage
-----------------------
	- As mentioned, Christine is superior to Aviana in almost every other way, hit-harder, faster, and much stronger & effective ailments.
	- Christine dance also make enemies  -40% accuracy and -40% defense so much more easier to kill. They are effectively sandbags. Two only way to remove Christine dance is to cast another "dance special skill", or kill Christine herself. With -40% accuracy, this is much difficult (except for the elves, which is "never miss")

Head-to-Head Synergy Analysis with Other Heroes:
------------------
	- Aviana needs to pair with heroes who give buffs, so that Aviana can be "Fast" instead of "Average". Also, pair her with other 2024 family heroes will give her extra bonus.
	- Christine Daae has to be avoid pairing her with allies giving ailments, since all other ailments will be replaced by Christine's dance. So pair her with buffs maker or hard-hitters to finish the enemy team off.

Winner:
---------
It is clear from the analysis that Christine is the much better one here. This is true on both PvP and PvE mode in general.

Viselus vs.  Alucard

Power: 851
Attack: 852
Defense: 803
Health: 1454
Speed: Very Fast
Class: Sorcerer

Special Skills
['Destroys all Minions from the target and nearby enemies.', 'Deals 250% damage to the target and nearby enemies.', 'All allies recover 10% health for each destroyed Minion.', 'All allies get 3% mana for each destroyed Minion.', 'The attack bypasses defensive buffs. This includes counterattacks.']

Passives
['Steal Buff - When this character casts their Special Skill, they have a 50% chance to steal the newest dispellable buff from a random enemy that has buffs. If no enemy has buffs, deals 70% damage to all enemies.']



********************
Head to Head Analysis
********************
Stat: Alucard has slightly better overall stat. Breaking down, Alucard has 20% more attack stat, but slightly weaker defense and HP, so Viselus is more durable.

Overall: Both are 3-enemies hitter which can eliminate minions instantly. However, they differ in speed, minion after-effects, and DoT.


Viselus Advantage
-----------------------
	- Surprisingly, Viselus actually damage slightly more instantly as we can see the calculation details:
		○ Alucard : 250% x 852 = 2,130 
		○ Viselus: 310% x 716 = 2,219
	
	Viselus has also significant DoT poison of base 574, or around 1100 with LB2 +25 and legendary troop. This surprisingly make Viselus a decent hitter even though he has bad attack stat. 
	Nevertheless, their overall-in-game damage may be roughly the same as Alucard has superior very fast speed.
	- Combining with his better defense & HP (also better with his 2023 family bonus which +10% even more defense), Viselus can be more reliable to survive enemy hit
	- Viselus passive is also surprisingly good than most people thought. He heal 2% per poison per enemy per turn. Note that he poison to 3 enemies for 4 turns, this actually make Viselus heal 2% x 3 x 4 = 24% which is equivalent to a good secondary healer of the team.

Alucard Advantage
-----------------------
	- The main advantage is his "Very Fast" speed, which almost guarantee that he mostly destroy most minions in time before the minions will show any of their special effects. For example, if minions can heal the owner, Alucard can kill them off instantly, while for Viselus, the minions may successfully heal the owners 1-2 turns at least.

Note that with Waterpipe's minion which can cut mana, the chance of both Alucard and Viselus are reduced to 50-50 and 20-80 respectively.
	- Alucard can "bypass" defensive buffs, so in this situation where enemy have defensive buffs, Alucard can produce more instant damage than Viselus. However, this may not compensate Viselus DoT.
	- With minions destroying, Alucard can heal even more than Viselus! For examples, he heal 30% just for 3 minions, and also give 9% mana to allies.
	
Head-to-Head Synergy Analysis with Other Heroes:
------------------
	- With his passive "Heal-over-time", he can synergize very well with heroes who has advantage on healing. For example, R&N and Sir Casmir got mana every time they got healed. He also pair well to other poison caster so that his passive heal can activate most of the time. Or he can pair with other DoT type for stacking.

If he pair with other 2023-family, he will get even more defense bonus.

	- Alucard can pair well with attack-buffer so that his bypassing will show the most potential. If he pair with other Morlovia family heroes, he get more mana-generation bonus (but this may not be significant as he is already Very Fast)

Winner:
---------
Surprisingly, I found Viselus is a little bit better in "most" situation as described above where Viselus can provide more damage even with his inferior attack stat. (similar damage in total overall-in-game damage if taking into account Alucard speed)

The main difference maker is that Viselus can provide reliable heal which is very important on both PvP and PvE, where as Alucard needs minion summoners on this effect.

Alucard has a certain situation where he is better, which is when enemies has a lot of minion summoners, or additionally, lots of defensive buffers, where Alucard can shine the best. Nevertheless, minion summoners are not popular nowadays due to many existing minion-counters (including both Alucard, Viselus and "Lunar"-family heroes)

********************
Head to Head Analysis
********************
Stat: Vainamoinen has a significantly better stat around 10% in all areas.

Overall: Both are green 3-target hitters with a focus on different aspects. Vainamoinen is faster and focused on control with an accuracy ailment, while The Hatter is slower but can do a buff stealer, offering a potentially chaotic gameplay twist.

Their damage output have different aspects:
	- Vainamoinen hit-3 with damage 799x270% = 2,157 to all 3 enemies
	- Hatter hit major damage = 735*400% = 2,940 to the main enemy and minor (half) = 2940/2 = 1470 to nearby enemies.
You can see that Hatter hit the main enemy harder, while Vainamoinen total hit on 3 is harder. So on damage, it's depend that you want to focus on a single enemy or 3-enemies altogether. 

However, I would say with recent heroes in 2024 equipped with Legendary troop, the damage these two old heroes made are quite negligible, so we may focus on their non-damage capabilities.

 Vainamoinen Advantage
-----------------------
	- Faster hit, faster ailment
	- The accuracy-ailment is not bad, but with only 30%, it can increase survivability of the whole team a bit. We may need to pair him with other fast-green dodger to help avoid enemies special.
	- His passive is good, effectively make him 15% more HP, much more durable than the Hatter. The mana addition is not too much since he is already fast.


Hatter Advantage
-----------------------
	- Only one advantage on the Hatter is the buff-stealing. Nevertheless, this is huge as this game much evolve around buffs. So this skill can be game changer, unlike Vainamoinen which do a lot of boring things.
	
Head-to-Head Synergy Analysis with Other Heroes:
------------------
	- Pair Vainamoinen with 
		○ dodger to better enemies special
		○ Other red-killer heroes to focus on red enemies
		○ Some heroes which can change enemy's color e.g. Salmon Loki or Chameleon
	- Pair Hatter with
		○ Healer and defense buffer, since Hatter with weak defense & HP stat really needs to survive to make a difference

Winner:
---------
Even though Vainamoinen is better than Hatter is almost aspects, the buff stealing is game changer and can make you win almost immediately when facing buff-heavy team. Vainamoinen may be better but boring, and can be substitute with many better green, while Hatter, though weak, is very unique and is more desirable to have in player's roster.
