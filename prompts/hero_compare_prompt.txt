Lets assume you are an expert in a mobile game "Empires & Puzzles" from Zynga. Now I would like you to compare the two cards for pros and cons of each card. Be very critical and accurate. Do not need to emphasize the weaker hero.

Following these examples:

=============================
Example 1:
Willow vs. Bennu

********************
Head to Head Analysis
********************

Overall: These two heroes have partial similarity. Namely, both can do counterattack and damage reduction. However, the main difference is that Willow has wider variety of skills.


Bennu Advantage
-----------------------
Bennu is specialized on counter-attack. He generally has a bit stronger counterattack compared to Willow on 5 turns. Also, his damage-reduction is 5% more than Willow, but more importantly, the damage reduction is applied "after" counterattack. This make the counterattack very strong while the damage receive very minor. 

For example, original 100 damage to one ally may produce 120 counter on turn 3, and the ally will receive only 50 damage himself.

In contrast, Willow reduce the damage "before" counter attack. Therefore, in the above example, Willow's ally will receive 55 damage, and counter only 55*1.15 = 63.25 damage. You can see that Bennu produce almost twice the damage of Willow.

Bennu passive allow him 60% chance to clean latest cleansable ailment which is good. Also 60% chance to heal 10% is kind of nice, but inferior overall to Willow's 2nd passive.

Willow Advantage
-----------------------
Having said that, Willow is a kind of swiss-knife who does a different of thing. In addition to counterattack on his 2nd charge, Willow also does 3 other things :

	1) Willow let all allies bypass all enemies defensive buff, so enemies defense-buff are now useless
	2) With passive 1, Willow will give -10% mana-(de)generation stack to enemies. This is uncleansible and last forever, which is fairly strong
	3) With passive 2, Willow will give 15% heal with 100% chance on 2nd charge.

Although this 2nd charge is slower than Bennu's average speed, it is more applicable when facing defense oriented team, because of the bypassing. Also, with 15% heal and mana-degeneration-stack, Willow allow the team to survive better.

To summarize, while Bennu is specialized only on hard-hitter opponent, Willow can face both hard-hitter and also defense-oriented opponent. In the latter situation, Willow 1st-charge becomes useful as it is very fast and can dispel and block all defensive buff on enemies.

Head-to-Head Synergy Analysis with Other Heroes:
------------------
With swiss-knife property, Willow seems to be more suitable to synergy to various kind of other heroes compared to Bennu. For example, both synergize well with other-type defense buffers, but Willow alone synergize also well with hard-hitter (because Willow give the bypassing to the hard-hitter)

Winner:
---------
Willow is a winner here with small margin due to his/her wider applications though a bit weaker counterattacker. Willow also has a slightly more stat power than Bennu, especially on Defense + Health stats which are most important for support heroes.

=============================
Example 2:
Starlass vs.  Xandrella

Starlass Description:
Element: Green
Star: 5
Power: 1062
Attack: 1032
Defense: 1165
Health: 1788
Speed: Slow
Class: Ranger

Special Skills
['This Special Skill never misses its targets.', 'Deals 550% damage to target and nearby enemies', 'Automatically does 701 damage to the hit enemy and consumes 75% mana from hit enemy every time when the hit enemy’s mana gets full for 3 tuns.']
Passives
['Resist Poison: This character has innate resistance against Poison.', 'Share Received Damage: 20% of damage received by this charater is shared with other allies.']


Xandrella Description:
Element: Green
Star: 5
Power: 900
Attack: 844
Defense: 854
Health: 1724
Speed: Average
Class: Sorcerer

Special Skills
['Deals 450% damage to target and all Ice enemies.', 'Automatically does 438 damage to the target and all Ice enemies, when their mana is full and reduces their mana by 50% for 4 turns.', 'Alters the power of all Nature shields on the board. When an attacking Hero casts the special, the shields become enhanced and give +37% more mana. When a defending Hero casts the special, the shields become weakened and give -30% less mana.']

Passives
['Troop Mastery: This Passive Skill has two different functions based on if this character is in attack or in defense.', 'Passive Skill as attacking character: This character’s Troops deal +100% more additional damage against weaker element.', 'Passive Skill as defending character: This character receives -10% less additional damage from Troops of stronger element.']



********************
Head to Head Analysis
********************
Overall: These two heroes are actually quite similar in their main function. Namely, both are rangers which can do "mana control" which is one of the most important in the game. Both control mana with the same mechanic, by reducing mana of enemies when the mana-bar is full.

Starlass has 3 targets with slow, while Xandrella is average speed, but the number of targets depending on the number of ice enemies. 


Xandrella Advantage
-----------------------
	- If there > 2 ice enemies, Xandrella can also hit 3 targets with quicker average speed
	- The quicker speed means Xandrella can better stop the enemy at the most critical moment
	- On Attack, Xandrella help other green heroes to charge faster by increase mana on the board's tiles (aka. Board shields), while on attack Xandrella negatively affect the green enemies by decrease the mana on the board tiles.
	- The passive make Xandrella tile attack quite good
	- Mana control of Starlass last only 3 turns while Xandrella last 4 turns.

Starlass Advantage
-----------------------
	- Clearly Starlass is much stronger stat-wise, so if %damage in special skill is equal, Starlass always hit harder and has better survivability. In fact, he has 20% better attack stat, and around 30% more defense stat.
	- Not only that, his special is considerably much stronger than Xandrella with 550% to 3 enemies. The 2nd effect is also much stronger i.e. 701 vs. 438 (Note that with LB2, +25 emblems, and legendary troops, both numbers are upgraded almost twice to around 1300 vs. 750)
	- The third effect is arguably no winner. Though Starlass reduce higher 75%, the reduction of 50% of Xandrella can make the 2nd effect activate again easier.
	- Though slower than Xandrella, if Starlass can fire, with the right partner, he has a chance to finish all 3 enemies with single blow, while it is much less likely with Xandrella.
	- His "never-miss" skill can be paired nicely with Gamble-attack-buff heroes like WuKong so that his special damage will be much stronger and still always hit. (though there are no green-gamble heroes, and WuKong is yellow, so off-color to Starlass). But there can be green-gamble heroes in the future.
	- His passive of 20% share damage make him even much better surviability, but his poison resistance is just a nice-to-have (nothing extraordinary)

Head-to-Head Synergy Analysis with Other Heroes:
------------------
As they both have the same main functional, they can be synergized by the same heroes. E.g. green defense-down (DD) or elemental defense down (EDD), or any other attack-buff heroes.

Winner:
---------
Starlass is a clear winner here. Though Starlass speed is at disadvantage, but once Starlass fires, Starlass will likely finish the job.

=============================
Example 3:
Rochefort vs. Voidstar 

Rochefort Description: 
Element: Purple
Star: 5
Power: 928 
Attack: 883 
Defense: 850 
Health: 1835 
Speed: Average 
Class: Fighter 

Special Skills: 
['Deals 565% damage to the target and minor damage to nearby enemies.', 'If the targets is defeated in 3 turns all enemies receive 626 damage.'] 

Passives: ['When this character receives damage from Special Skills or in place of a character in Cover, there’s a 60% chance of deal 20% of the received damage on all enemies.'] 

Voidstar Description:
Element: Purple
Star: 5
Power: 1041 
Attack: 1003 
Defense: 1114 
Health: 1814 
Speed: Average 
Class: Paladin 

Special Skills: 
['This Special Skill never misses its targets.', 'Deals 620% damage to the target.', 'Heals all allies for 40% of the damage dealt.', 'All allies get +74% defense against Special Skills for 4 turns.'] 

Passives: ['Resist Poison: This character has innate resistance against Poison.', 'Share Received Damage: 20% of damage received by this charater is shared with other allies.']


********************
Head to Head Analysis
********************
Overall: These two are similar, average speed, purple, hard hitter. We can see that Voidstar is the more recent hero so better stat on all measures (around 15%).


Rochefort Advantage
-----------------------
	- Only one advantage against Voidstar is Rochefort's secondary effect provided that the hit enemy is dead within 3 turns, which results in 626 damages to all enemies. 
	
	With LB2, +25 emblems, and legendary troops, 626 damages is upgraded almost twice to around 1150
	
Note that in 2022-2023, 1150 damages can consider to be good and send enemies to blink of the death, but in 2024 in which each hero has legendary troop and recent heroes will have HP as high as 3,000. So the 1000 to 1150 damage is good but not enough . So he needs another (perhaps purple) partner to fire with him
	
	
Voidstar Advantage
-----------------------
	- At the above stat, Voidstar special with his attack stat can deal 620%*1003 = 6218.6 while Rochefort's damage is 565% * 883 = 4,988.95. So Voidstar is around 20% hit harder than Rochefort
	- With "never-miss", Voidstar has potential to combine with the Gamble-attack-buff, and hit even harder
	- Void also provide excellent defense or survivability support with healing and strong defense buff
	- Voidstar defense / Rochefort defense = 1114 / 850 = 1.3106 , or around 31% better (they have the same HP)
	- Not only that, with passive to share 20% damage to friends, and with Paladin class, Voidstar is much more durable than Rochefort.

Head-to-Head Synergy Analysis with Other Heroes:
------------------
If function as a hard-hitter, both can have similar synergy to other hard hitters, preferably purple to be on-color. In that regard, Rochefort's 2nd effect can activate, and can produce total damage higher than Voidstar. 

Nevertheless, Voidstar's "special skill" defense buff can stack with "normal" defense buff, so he synergize also well with other defense-oriented heroes to protect the whole team.

Winner:
---------
Both are good, but Voidstar is the clear hero here.
